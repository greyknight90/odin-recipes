        This is a fantastic recipe to make in advance and keep in your fridge (or freezer) to eat throughout the week with pretty much anything. Cut it up into smaller pieces, and throw them into a yummy stir fry! Or perhaps you want to make vegan spam musubi. Options are endless!.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 block tofu extra firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce or alternative</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup or agave nectar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp liquid smoke</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin Japanese sweet rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To start making your vegan spam by cutting up your tofu and slice horizontally into thin rectangular pieces – one block will make approximately 10-12 pieces. You can cut off the edges to make them round so that your tofu slice is more of an oval vs rectangle (to make it more spam-like).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, create the vegan spam marinade by adding the soy sauce, maple syrup, liquid smoke, mirin, ground ginger, garlic powder, and water. Mix well. </li>
        <li>In a flat container, lay your tofu slices flat and pour in the vegan spam marinade, making sure each tofu piece is soaking well. I recommend marinating for at least an hour to overnight or if short for time, marinate for 10-15 minutes (preferably 15) on each side.</li>
        <li>To bake your vegan spam in the oven, transfer tofu pieces onto a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 375°F. After 15 minutes, flip the tofu pieces and pour the rest of the marinade on the tofu. Bake for another 15 minutes. This makes the total baking time 30 minutes. .</li>
        <li>Alternatively (for a quicker method), you can pan-fry on medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on one side (when it's caramelized), then flip and pour in the remaining marinade and pan fry for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
