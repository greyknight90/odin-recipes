--INTRO--

This is a simple project to create a recipe website with multiple pages to demonstrate using links, images, and basic HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Before starting this project, I already knew and understood this information, but I am completing it anyway as part of The Odin Project.


--REFLECTION--

As expected, I knew all of the HTML pieces. However, this was my first time actually using Git and Github to commit and push to my account, so that was valueable experience to have. I feel as if I understand these two platforms better after having some hands-on practice.
